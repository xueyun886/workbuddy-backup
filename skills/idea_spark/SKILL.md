# Idea Spark Skill

Convert an under-specified research direction into ONE reviewer-defensible Oral-level research proposal ‚Ä?grounded in 1947 ICLR/ICML/NeurIPS papers (2021-2025) ‚Ä?via a 5-phase workflow: retrieve recent literature, diagnose the bottleneck, select + generate a candidate using corpus-derived ideation pattern cards, run it through a quality gauntlet, expand into an idea card.

This file is the operational runbook. Design rationale (the 7 design principles, why each contract is shaped this way, removed-check history) lives in [references/design-notes.md](references/design-notes.md) ‚Ä?read it only when modifying or evaluating the skill, never needed to run it. When MODIFYING the skill, also replay the cross-shape regression set in [references/regression-directions.md](references/regression-directions.md) (deterministic subset: `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/regression_check.py" <run_dir>`; routing/merger branch fixtures ‚Ä?including every guard/retry branch that real runs rarely exercise: `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/selftest_routing.py"`). First-time installation lives in [references/setup.md](references/setup.md).

## When to use

- "Give me a research idea in {area} I could pursue." / "What's the most impactful next step in this direction?"
- "Help me sharpen this vague direction into an Oral-level proposal."
- "What's the bottleneck of this problem?" / "Run a novelty audit on this idea."

## When NOT to use

- Code review, debugging, refactoring. Summarizing one paper. Cross-decade survey writing.
- Free-association brainstorming with no research context. Engineering integration tasks ("ship this feature in our system").
- Pure benchmark / dataset construction work ‚Ä?the 15-pattern vocabulary handles benchmark *audit* (controlled_diagnostic_design) but not benchmark *construction*.

## Setup (first use only)

Follow [references/setup.md](references/setup.md). Quick version ‚Ä?set two shell variables, install deps, verify:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=<path to this folder>                  # e.g. ~/.workbuddy/skills/idea_spark (Claude Code), ~/.workbuddy/skills/idea_spark (Codex CLI), or any clone location (WorkBuddy: ~/.workbuddy/skills/idea_spark)
RUN_DIR="$PWD/ideaspark_run/<topic-slug>" && mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"   # convention below; any absolute dir works
python3 -m pip install feedparser openreview-py beautifulsoup4 pymupdf
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" check_connectors   # from the SAME shell you'll run phases from
```

Credentials go in `.env` (OpenReview user/pass + Semantic Scholar key ‚Ä?see setup.md); the orchestrator auto-loads it. Optional: `xelatex`/`tectonic` for PDF cards.

## How to run: the `next` loop

The canonical way to drive a run is the **run-state navigator**:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" next --dir "$RUN_DIR" --query "<user's research question>"
```

**Run-dir convention (one run = one directory, named by the host BEFORE the first command):** `$PWD/ideaspark_run/<topic-slug>` ‚Ä?a short kebab-case slug distilled from the user's direction (e.g. `ideaspark_run/diffusion-watermark`); if the slug is taken, append `_2`, not a timestamp. NEVER reuse a directory that already contains a `phase0/` ‚Ä?every phase writes into `$RUN_DIR` and would clobber the prior run. The skill itself never names the dir (any absolute path works); this convention exists so runs from different harnesses land in one predictable place instead of each agent improvising.

`next` inspects the artifacts already on disk and prints EXACTLY one next step ‚Ä?either a Bash command to run verbatim, or an LLM sub-agent spec (system-prompt path + input file paths + output path + the routing signal to report back). It is read-only and idempotent (safe to re-run anytime, including to resume an interrupted run). The host loop is:

1. Run `next`.
2. Do what it says (`bash` ‚Ü?run the command; `llm_subagent` ‚Ü?execute in an ISOLATED context per the Context discipline rules below).
3. Run `next` again. Repeat until it reports a terminal state (`DONE`, `do_not_generate`, or `phase_3_failed`).

**Consume every emit WHOLE ‚Ä?never grep/filter/truncate the block.** INPUT lists span unlabeled continuation lines; a label-keyed grep (`grep -E "STEP|INPUT|..."`) silently drops them. This exact failure occurred in a live run: the navigator listed the coherence gate's blocking findings as an audit input, the host's grep dropped the line, and the audit issued a false `advance` without ever seeing the executed evidence. If the emit must be captured into a bounded tool result, `head -c 4000` the WHOLE block ‚Ä?never filter by line labels.

`next` encodes the full phase graph ‚Ä?the mandatory full-text gate, the citation gate, the abandon-retry branch, the falsification re-audit branch, and the correct Phase 4 flags per path ‚Ä?so you do not need to memorize the reference tables below; they exist for deviation and debugging.

If your host exposes a task/todo tool (e.g., TodoWrite), seed it with this checklist and tick phases as `next` moves past them:

```
- [ ] Phase 0: Literature grounding ‚Ü?lit_table.md, then Phase 0+ full-text fetch (MANDATORY ‚Ä?Phase 1 hard-gates on it)
- [ ] Phase 1: Bottleneck identification ‚Ü?phase1_output.json (routing: proceed | do_not_generate)
- [ ] Phase 2: Gap√ópattern selection + candidate generation (ONE isolated context, TWO output files) ‚Ü?citation gate ‚Ü?coherence gate (dry-run trace, fresh context)
- [ ] Phase 3: Collision retrieval (signature@10mo + alias@48mo ‚Ä?launchable in parallel with 2.3) ‚Ü?audit (5 checks) ‚Ü?[revise ‚Ü?merge ‚Ü?re-audit if falsification rewritten] | [abandon ‚Ü?1 internal retry] | [2nd abandon, both subsumption-killed ‚Ü?1 bottleneck re-diagnosis + 1 candidate attempt; else phase_3_failed]
- [ ] Phase 4: skeleton ‚Ü?fill (technical) ‚Ü?assemble partial ‚Ü?derive (plain, fast-tier) ‚Ü?assemble final + method view ‚Ü?implementability audit ‚Ü?validate ‚Ü?render ‚Ü?return 3 cards inline
```

Three outcomes per run: the rendered idea-card markdown returned inline (LaTeX + per-phase JSON left under `$RUN_DIR`), a `do_not_generate.md` (Phase 1 OOD), or a `phase_3_failed.md` (audit abandons twice). **Never ask the user mid-flow** ‚Ä?missing intake fields are inferred; revision, falsification re-audit, and the single internal retry all run without user re-invocation.

### Invocation contract

**No `cd` is required.** `scripts/run.py` self-locates its skill root, so every orchestrator command can be invoked from ANY working directory by absolute script path: `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" <subcommand> --out "$RUN_DIR/<phase>/" ...`. The legacy form `cd "$SKILL_DIR" && python3 -m scripts.run <subcommand> ...` works identically. Do NOT use relative script or `--out` paths ‚Ä?CWD is not stable across host-LLM Bash invocations, and the orchestrator rejects a relative `--out` outright.

**Exit codes 10 and 11 are NOT errors ‚Ä?they are sentinel handshakes.** When the orchestrator can't call an LLM itself (no `NOVELTY_LLM_CLASSIFY_FAST_CMD`), it writes a sentinel JSON describing what the host LLM should do, then exits rc=10 (intent / pattern-summary) or rc=11 (signature_terms). Read the sentinel (`$RUN_DIR/<phase>/.<step>_pending`), read the file at its `rubric_file` field (absolute path), produce the expected output, re-invoke per its `re_invocation` field. Do not stop on these codes. (The default Phase 0 flow below avoids the rc=10 intent sentinel entirely by passing `--queries` up front.)

### Context discipline (read BEFORE running any LLM-driven phase)

A full run accumulates ~180-250k tokens of intermediate state. If the host LLM carries that in its own conversation context across phases, the Phase 1 / 2.2 / 4.fill calls routinely hit the backend request timeout (`[API Error ¬∑ Request timed out ¬∑ Retrying...]`) and the retry times out again. Apply ALL three rules on every run:

**Rule 1 ‚Ä?Run every LLM-driven phase in an ISOLATED context.** Phases 1 / 2 (2.1+2.2) / 2.3 / 3.2 / 3.3 / 4.fill / 4.1.5 each have file-path inputs and one JSON output; no phase needs the conversation that produced an earlier one. Use the FIRST isolation mechanism your harness supports:

- **(a) Subprocess LLM** ‚Ä?set `NOVELTY_LLM_REASONING_LARGE_CMD` / `NOVELTY_LLM_CLASSIFY_FAST_CMD` (see ¬ß Configuration); each phase runs as its own subprocess, fresh context by construction, on any harness.
- **(b) Sub-agent tool** (Claude Code `Agent` or equivalent) ‚Ä?spawn one per phase, passing ONLY the file paths the phase prompt lists ‚Ä?not conversation history, not file contents inline. The sub-agent reads from disk, `Write`s to disk, returns ‚â?250 words (output path + routing signal). Exception by design: Phase 2.1 and 2.2 run in ONE sub-agent writing both output files ‚Ä?both are generation-side; the adversarial separations (3.2 vs 3.3, 4.fill vs 4.1.5) must stay separate calls.
- **(c) Manual context reset** ‚Ä?run inline but clear/compact at the four points in Rule 3.

Whichever mechanism, the parent context stays ‚â?~30k tokens for the whole run because it never holds a phase's structured output.

**Rule 2 ‚Ä?`Write` every phase artifact directly to disk; never paraphrase it into chat.** Output convention: `$RUN_DIR/<phase>/<phase>_output.json`. Use your harness's file-write tool (Claude Code: `Write`) ‚Ä?no Bash heredocs (permission prompts + silent truncation), no `echo`, no pasting JSON into replies. Bound tool-result captures from large files to ‚â?4 KB (`head -c 4000` / `jq` / `sed`); never `Read` a >10 KB intermediate dump into the parent context ‚Ä?the dump gets cached into every subsequent turn (this exact anti-pattern caused prior timeout runs).

**Rule 3 ‚Ä?Compact between phases.** Natural compact points: after Phase 0+, after Phase 1, after Phase 2, after Phase 3.2. Every phase re-reads its disk inputs, so compacting loses nothing. With `/compact`, use it there; Rule 1 mechanisms (a)/(b) achieve the same on their own.

**Diagnostic for "Request timed out" mid-phase:** inspect your harness's session transcript/log (Claude Code: `~/.claude/projects/<project-slug>/<session-id>.jsonl`, look for `isApiErrorMessage: true`; other harnesses: their session-log equivalent); the prior tool call shows which prompt got too big. The fix is one of the three rules ‚Ä?usually Rule 1.

## Phase reference

`next` prints each of these steps at the right moment with concrete paths; the tables below are the full contract for deviation/debugging.

### Orchestrator entry points

| Phase | Entry point (`python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" ...`, any CWD) |
|---|---|
| navigator | `next --dir "$RUN_DIR" [--query "..."]` |
| Phase 0 | `phase0 --query "<user text>" --queries "q1\|q2\|q3\|q4" --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/` |
| user-ref registration (title-named anchor papers; BEFORE phase0_fulltext) | `add_user_ref --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/ --title "<full title>" [--raw-match "<user phrasing>"] [--id <arxiv/DOI/URL>]` |
| Phase 0+ full-text (**mandatory**, the moment lit_table.md lands) | `phase0_fulltext --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/` |
| Phase 1 anchor top-up (optional, when the #1 closest_adjacent fell outside the fulltext pool) | `phase1_fulltext_topup --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/ --paper-id <anchor paper_id>` |
| Phase 2 prep (deterministic; `next` emits it with the Phase 2 step) | `phase2_prepare --dir $RUN_DIR` |
| lit_table shard assembly (deterministic; after parallel pattern tagging) | `lit_table_merge --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/ --shards <rows1.md> <rows2.md> ...` |
| Phase 3.1 collision | `phase3_collision --idea-json <canonical candidate> --out $RUN_DIR/phase3_collision/` |
| Phase 3.3 merger | `phase3_merge_revisions --phase2 <canonical candidate> --revisions <p3.3-patch> --critique <p3.2-report> --out $RUN_DIR/phase3_revise/` |
| Phase 2.3 merger (same tool; only when coherence verdict=patched) | `phase3_merge_revisions --phase2 <p2.2-output> --revisions <p2.3-output> --out $RUN_DIR/phase2_coherence/ --out-name refined_candidate.json` |
| Phase 4 skeleton | `phase4_skeleton --candidate <final_candidate-or-p2.2> --phase1 ... --phase2-select ... --phase3-critique ... [--phase3-revise ...] --phase0-dir $RUN_DIR/phase0/ [--collision ...] --out $RUN_DIR/phase4/` |
| Phase 4 assemble (repeat `--fill-map` to merge the derive_map on the final pass) | `phase4_assemble --skeleton $RUN_DIR/phase4/phase4_skeleton.json --fill-map $RUN_DIR/phase4/fill_map.json [--fill-map $RUN_DIR/phase4/derive_map.json] --out $RUN_DIR/phase4/` |
| Phase 4 method view (before 4.1.5; `next` bundles it with the final assemble) | `phase4_method_view --expansion $RUN_DIR/phase4/phase4_expansion.json --out $RUN_DIR/phase4/` |
| Phase 4 render | `phase4_render --expansion $RUN_DIR/phase4/phase4_expansion.json --out $RUN_DIR/phase4/` |
| Validators | `validate --phase2 ... [--phase3 ...] [--phase4 ...] [--phase4-impl ...]` |

The LLM-driven phases (1 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 2.3 / 3.2 / 3.3 / 4.fill / 4.1.5 / falsification re-audit) have no orchestrator subcommand (a `cat prompt | llm` wrapper would add fragility without determinism): read the prompt at `references/system-prompts/<phase>.txt`, gather the inputs listed at its top, `Write` the JSON described under `Output:` to `$RUN_DIR/<phase>/<phase>_output.json`. Run each under the Context discipline rules ‚Ä?Phase 4.fill is the largest output and the most timeout-prone; never in the parent context.

### Phase 0 ‚Ä?Literature grounding

Phase 0 and 3.1 require **real external retrieval** via the bundled connector scripts (`scripts/search_*.py`) ‚Ä?never WebSearch or ad-hoc fetch (downstream phases reject unstructured output). Gate sentinel: `.lit_grounding_mode` = `real` vs `connector_failure` (halt with diagnostic; `--allow-webfallback` exists as a flagged, lower-confidence escape).

**Default flow (skips one sentinel round-trip):** BEFORE invoking `phase0`, read `references/intent-recognition.md` (Map mode) yourself and produce 4-6 search queries ‚Ä?including one ESCAPE-MECHANISM query phrased in solution vocabulary (recalls papers that already fixed the bottleneck and title themselves by their fix; problem-keyed queries miss exactly those). Phrase queries mechanism-first: generic "`<topic>` challenges/overview/landscape" phrasings are survey magnets that dilute corpus density ‚Ä?the orchestrator demotes survey-titled hits to the bottom of lit_results (kept, never dropped), but each connector's cap slots are still spent on them. Also apply the OOD short-circuit (intake-routing.md triggers #1 Too-broad / #2 No-anchor ‚Ü?route to do_not_generate instead of retrieving). Then invoke with BOTH flags:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" phase0 --query "<user's research question>" --queries "q1|q2|q3|q4" --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/
```

The rc=10 sentinel path still exists as fallback when `--queries` is omitted. The orchestrator: asserts a sane clock; probes 4 connectors and retrieves role-based (arxiv 0-6mo cap 10 / openalex 6-24mo cap 12 published-only / semanticscholar 6-24mo cap 13 published-only / openreview 0-6mo cap 10 in-review; ~40-45 papers; non-overlapping windows; SS-priority dedup); extracts URL/ID user-refs from the query into `phase0/user_refs.json`; emits `.pattern_summary_pending` for the host.

Retrieval takes 3-10 min (the openreview connector alone budgets 600s) ‚Ä?set your Bash timeout ‚â?600s or run it in the background.

**Pattern tagging (host step):** classify each `lit_results.json` paper per `references/pattern-summary-rubric.md` into 1-3 of the 15 patterns ‚Ü?write `lit_table.md` with columns `paper_id | year_month | venue | title | ideation pattern tags | bottleneck this paper targets | open issue / unresolved gap | resolves_problem | retrieved_via`. Pure classification ‚Ä?it does not need the large reasoning model: route it to a cheaper/faster model tier or a lower reasoning effort BY DEFAULT (the same tier `NOVELTY_LLM_CLASSIFY_FAST_CMD` names in ¬ß Configuration; spending the large model here is pure waste ‚Ä?a real run measured ~85k large-model tokens for 33 papers); only when no cheaper tier exists, run it isolated on the host model. Rows are per-paper independent, so for 40+ papers the tagging MAY be sharded across 2-3 parallel fast-tier sub-agents (contiguous slices; assemble with the deterministic `lit_table_merge --out $RUN_DIR/phase0/ --shards <row-file>...` ‚Ä?it validates 9-column shape, row count == paper count, and paper_id coverage against lit_results.json, replacing hand-checks) ‚Ä?wall-clock win, no quality delta.

**Title-named user refs:** if the user query names anchor papers by TITLE ("based on the LoRA paper" ‚Ä?anything the URL/ID regex can't catch), register each BEFORE `phase0_fulltext` via `add_user_ref` (entry-point table). It does a deterministic dedup-merge into `user_refs.json` ‚Ä?do NOT hand-edit that file (some harnesses' file-write tools refuse to overwrite a file that was never read, and a malformed edit silently drops the U fetch tier).

**Phase 0+ full-text fetch ‚Ä?MANDATORY.** The instant `lit_table.md` lands, run `phase0_fulltext` (entry-point table) before touching Phase 1. Pool = U (user refs, never capped) + T2 (top-10 published on-topic) + T3 (top-5 arxiv on-topic), ceiling 15 excluding U, method-first ordering, concurrent fetch (HTML path first, pymupdf PDF fallback; per-paper budget so one slow PDF can't stall the step). Output `fulltext_cache.json` keyed by paper_id (`{tier, intro, method, source_used, warning}`); fetch failures degrade to abstract + warning. Phase 1 **hard-gates** on this file (`error: fulltext_not_fetched`). Alongside the blob it writes a derived per-paper read view (`phase0/fulltext/index.json` + one `.md` per paper, same content, index carries tier/source_used/warning) ‚Ä?Phase 1 reads the index then only the papers it needs; the blob stays canonical and `phase1_fulltext_topup` refreshes both. Fetches hit a cross-run content cache (`~/.cache/ideaspark/fulltext/`, successful fetches only, 30-day TTL; disable with `IDEASPARK_FETCH_CACHE=off`), so papers recurring across runs on adjacent topics cost zero network time.

### Phase 1 ‚Ä?Bottleneck identification

One isolated LLM call. Prompt: [references/system-prompts/bottleneck_identify.txt](references/system-prompts/bottleneck_identify.txt). Inputs: user query + intake, `phase0/lit_table.md`, `phase0/fulltext_cache.json` (all-failed cache ‚Ü?continue with `fulltext_degraded: true`, abstract-level residue confidence), `phase0/lit_results.json`. Output `phase1/phase1_output.json`: `intake` (+`_inferred_fields[]` ‚Ä?missing fields are inferred, never asked), `bottleneck_statement` (‚â? paper_id cited inline), `closest_adjacent[]` (`{paper_id, summary_and_residue}`), `what_phase_0_did_not_address[]` (each gap ends with an inline stakes clause ‚Ä?practitioner costs and intellectual costs are coequal; gaps are framed as structural properties of a problem class when honestly true, with the anchor as primary instance, else declared class-of-one), `state ‚à?{proceed, do_not_generate}`.

Routing: **proceed** (literature-groundable, no OOD trigger) or **do_not_generate** (too-broad / no-anchor OOD, <5 truly-relevant papers, genuinely blank space, or benchmark/system construction) ‚Ü?write `do_not_generate.md` with concrete remedial steps ‚Ä?terminal.

### Phase 2 ‚Ä?Selection + generation (ONE isolated context, TWO outputs)

Run 2.1 and 2.2 back-to-back in one isolated context, writing BOTH output files (they are both generation-side; only adversarial pairs need separate calls):

**2.1** ‚Ä?prompt [references/system-prompts/ideate_select.txt](references/system-prompts/ideate_select.txt); inputs `phase1_output.json`, `references/ideation-patterns/overview.md` (all 15 patterns' Definition / Operational signature / When to apply ‚Ä?selection at WHAT/WHEN level), `references/ideation-patterns/companion-combos.md`, `lit_table.md`. Pick the anchor gap (type-bound to `intake.contribution_type`); commit the PATTERN COMPOSITION ‚Ä?‚â? distinct patterns by default, realized preferentially as a CHAIN on the anchor (attested second pattern from companion-combos, with a named intermediate object) and/or via a sibling that EARNS its seat through the removal test ("the anchor's story is incomplete without it") ‚Ä?anchor-only is legitimate and common (1-3 gaps total, ‚â? siblings); a single-pattern selection requires a `composition_note` defense (validator presence-checks it; audit weighs it). Record saturation (transparency, not a filter). Output `phase2_select/phase2_select_output.json`: `selected_gaps[]` (index 0 = anchor) + `coherence_thread_type` (or `n_a` when anchor-only) + `composition_note` + `pattern_saturation` + `deferred_gaps[]`. **Retry mode:** when `$RUN_DIR/attempt_1/` exists, the prompt's OPTIONAL retry input applies ‚Ä?the archived audit + selection become negative constraints; anchor-only is a valid retry outcome. **Cross-run dedup:** `next` scans sibling run dirs and appends a soft-negative-anchor input line (titles + signature terms of their canonical candidates, 5 most recent) so adjacent-direction runs don't silently re-invent the same mechanism family; soft by design (see ideate_select.txt's OPTIONAL cross-run input), disable with `IDEASPARK_CROSS_RUN_DEDUP=off`.

**2.2** ‚Ä?prompt [references/system-prompts/ideate_generate.txt](references/system-prompts/ideate_generate.txt); inputs 2.1 output, `phase1_output.json`, `lit_results.json` (closest_adjacent entries ONLY ‚Ä?filter to those paper_ids before reading; the prompt forbids pulling the full dump into context), plus for each gap ONE picked sub-pattern card from `references/ideation-sub-patterns/` (compare `when_to_pick_this_one` + `differentiation_within_parent` via its overview.md; then read the picked card's `tactical_pattern` + Step-by-Step). Output `phase2_generate/phase2_generate_output.json` ‚Ä?ONE candidate, 12 flat fields: `title` / `hook` / `core_mechanism` / `core_mechanism_reasoning` / `core_mechanism_steps`; `gap_closure[]` (`{gap, main_pattern, sub_pattern: "C## (parent pattern name)", how_closed}`, mirrors selected_gaps one-for-one); `falsification_prediction` (single paragraph: minimal experiment + metric-with-direction + ONE named load-bearing variable + negative control on that variable predicting the DOWNSTREAM outcome metric returns to baseline ‚Ä?non-tautological); `compute_budget` (user-relative, GPU-day line + API-dollar line when the campaign calls paid APIs; default intake envelope = 80GB-class GPUs, ‚â? concurrent, ‚â?50 GPU-days / 5 months, ~$10k API ‚Ä?overridable per user via `IDEASPARK_DEFAULT_COMPUTE`, see ¬ß Configuration); `differentiation_from_lit[]` (substantive deltas, not "different pattern"); `almost_prior_paper_id` + `what_step_was_missed`; `signature_terms[]` (own vocabulary ‚Ä?recent collision channel); `alias_terms[]` (other communities' names for the same mechanism, from parametric knowledge ‚Ä?multi-year alias collision channel); `composition_note` (echoed verbatim from 2.1). Reality constraints at writing time: `core_mechanism_reasoning` carries three mandatory blocks ‚Ä?a PREMISES ledger (load-bearing premises + domain justification; bets tagged `untested ‚Ä?falsification target`; WHEN the mechanism consumes sampled/observed data, at least one OBSERVATION-MODEL premise ‚Ä?how are the inputs sampled, is that unbiased here ‚Ä?else the literal `observation-model: n/a`; WHEN the mechanism estimates any quantity, declare the ESTIMAND precisely), a NAIVE-BASELINE AUDIT (state the naive version; why doesn't it already work ‚Ä?branch (i) naive relies on a false premise ‚Ü?confronting it IS the contribution, with a STANDARD-TOOL FOLLOW-UP: if the confrontation is a textbook tool from another field, name the domain-specific structure that makes this instance unsolved or declare the contribution application-grade, (ii) naive suffices ‚Ü?incremental signal surfaced honestly, (iii) naive works but the field disbelieves ‚Ü?minimalism with evidence), then design rationale ‚Ä?plus every invoked dataset / model-access level / annotation / tool must be a nameable EXISTING artifact (hard rule 3; modest self-built resources allowed with cost counted in compute_budget) and every claim stated at its defensible strength ‚Ä?guarantee-grade wording only with assumptions stated where it appears (hard rule 4; the coherence gate grades this, and a strong claim with honest assumptions beats a hedged weak one). Both kill-switch fields (`falsification_prediction`, `compute_budget`) are locked from here on ‚Ä?see Phase 3 for the single audited exception.

**Citation gate (deterministic, MANDATORY before Phase 3):**

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" validate --phase2 $RUN_DIR/phase2_generate/phase2_generate_output.json
```

Any `fail` = a `sub_pattern` citation was guessed from the parent's gist, not read from `overview.md`. Fix against `references/ideation-sub-patterns/overview.md` (or regenerate 2.2 with the card open) and re-run until clean ‚Ä?the gate proves parent-consistency only; whether core_mechanism performs the cluster's actual tactic is Phase 3.2's `recipe_application_check`. (`next` runs this gate automatically.)

**Coherence gate (2.3 ‚Ä?one isolated LLM call, MANDATORY after the citation gate, before the 3.2 audit; 3.1 collision may run CONCURRENTLY with it):** prompt [references/system-prompts/coherence_trace.txt](references/system-prompts/coherence_trace.txt); inputs: the 2.2 candidate + the 2.1 spec; MUST be a FRESH context, never the 2.1+2.2 agent (the context that wrote a logic bug rubber-stamps it). It verifies internal procedural validity by EXECUTION, not review ‚Ä?five trace actions: formalize the dataflow (undefined symbols, missing producers, circular deps), numeric dry-run on one small concrete instance (magnitude/probability absurdities ‚Ä?logic bugs read fluently and only surface when computed; when a code-execution tool exists the gate WRITES AND RUNS a stdlib Python script and pastes script+output, else hand-computes marked `unexecuted`), degenerate probes (empty/k=0/ties), claim‚Üístep mapping AND grading (every asserted property mapped to the step that establishes it AND graded `established` / `conditional` ‚Ä?assumptions listed / `overclaim` ‚Ä?wording downgraded / `empirical`; statistical claims settled by an executed Monte Carlo with the measured number, theorem-shaped claims recorded as proof obligations ‚Ä?at best conditional; grading never rewards vagueness: all-hedged claims are themselves a weakness finding), and a NAIVE-BASELINE COMPARISON (independently construct the naive version ‚Ä?never the candidate's own stated one ‚Ä?run it on the same instance, and judge against the candidate's declared branch: `confronts_obstacle` / `equivalent_to_naive` / `n_a`). OBSTACLE HOLES ‚Ä?findings whose honest fix is a redesign, or which coincide with the obstacle the candidate declares it exists to solve (incl. `equivalent_to_naive`) ‚Ä?must NOT be patched around with avoidance-style repairs (abstain/clamp/skip); they go to `unrepaired[]` as blocking, verbatim. Verdict `pass` | `patched`; repairs are patch-only via the SAME merger (`--out-name refined_candidate.json`), scoped to making the written procedure sound (core_mechanism*, how_closed narrative, signature/alias terms when the repair changed what the mechanism is) ‚Ä?novelty surface, pattern bindings, and kill-switch fields are out of scope; unfixable-without-redesign findings go to `unrepaired[]` for the audit to weigh. Single pass, never abandons. The 3.2 audit stays blind to this report's trace/verdict/patches ‚Ä?with ONE exception: blocking `unrepaired[]` entries are executed evidence, so the gate ALSO writes them to `phase2_coherence/blocking_findings.json` (self-contained: verbatim step quote + script excerpt + measured numbers + reading_dependence per entry), which `next` lists as a 3.2 input; the audit must disposition each (uphold, or refute by naming a concrete modeling/arithmetic flaw ‚Ä?`next` deterministically bounces an audit report that skipped dispositions or advanced over an upheld finding). Formalization ambiguity is controlled by the gate's dual-reading protocol (every defensible reading of an ambiguous operative term is executed; findings are tagged reading_robust vs reading_dependent). When `refined_candidate.json` exists it is the canonical candidate for every later phase (`next` wires this automatically). It validates that the algorithm survives on paper ‚Ä?NOT that it works empirically (falsification experiment) or is novel (audit).

### Phase 3 ‚Ä?Quality gauntlet

**3.1 collision (orchestrator, no LLM):** entry-point table. May be LAUNCHED IN PARALLEL with the 2.3 gate (on the 2.2 output ‚Ä?`next` emits the background launch alongside the 2.3 step): collision reads only `signature_terms[]`/`alias_terms[]`, a `.collision_terms.json` sidecar records the terms actually used, and `next` re-issues collision if a coherence patch changed those terms (rare ‚Ä?term repairs are scoped to mechanism-changing patches). TWO retrieval channels over all 4 connectors, merged into `collision_hits.json` with a per-hit `collision_channel` tag: **signature** ‚Ä?the candidate's `signature_terms[]` over a 10-month window (contemporaneous scoop risk); **alias** ‚Ä?the candidate's `alias_terms[]` (other communities' names for the same mechanism, produced from parametric knowledge at 2.2) over a 48-month window (renamed-ancestor risk ‚Ä?the "goal-conditioned success detector vs goal-image conditioned scorer" blind spot is lexical, not temporal, so widening the signature window alone cannot catch it). Missing `signature_terms[]` ‚Ü?rc=11 sentinel: produce BOTH term sets per intent-recognition.md Collision mode (terms 3-7 words each ‚Ä?long sentences break URL encoding), edit the candidate JSON, re-invoke. Missing only `alias_terms[]` ‚Ü?loud warning, alias channel skipped (add the field and re-run to close the blind spot). The audit-facing pool is relevance-truncated per channel (‚â?20 hits/channel by lexical overlap with the channel's own terms; zero-relevance BM25 noise dropped unconditionally; drops printed; untruncated pool preserved as `collision_hits.full.json`), so the audit can consume `collision_hits.json` in a few sequential Read chunks ‚Ä?no jq two-pass triage needed.

**3.2 audit (one isolated LLM call):** prompt [references/system-prompts/critique.txt](references/system-prompts/critique.txt); inputs: candidate, 2.1 spec, `lit_table.md`, `collision_hits.json`, `references/anti-patterns.md`, `phase2_coherence/blocking_findings.json` when it exists (the 2.3 gate's executed blocking evidence ‚Ä?the report must disposition each entry, and advance is forbidden while one is upheld; a `refuted` disposition additionally triggers a bounded refutation re-check (`refutation_recheck.txt`, fresh call) that `next` requires before trusting the verdict ‚Ä?an invalid refutation counts as upheld and bounces the audit), and each cited sub-pattern card `references/ideation-sub-patterns/<C##>.md` (strip the leading code from `sub_pattern`; typically 1-3 cards, others NOT loaded). Five corpus-anchored checks:

| Check | Question |
|---|---|
| gap_closure_reject_check | does the candidate match a documented Reject lesson in each cited sub-pattern card (`## Tactical failure mode` + ALL `### Reject lessons` bullets)? |
| recipe_application_check | does `core_mechanism` actually perform the cited C## cluster's `## Tactical pattern` signature move, or only the parent's generic idea (`bypassed` ‚Ä?the leading cause of incremental output)? |
| anti_pattern_check | if the SET of `gap_closure[].main_pattern` matches a reject-favored composition, is the required mitigation substantively delivered (artifact, not keyword)? |
| paper_pointed_threat | most specific subsuming/competing paper in `lit_table ‚à?collision_hits` (both channels; alias-channel threats are NOT discounted for age); `no_threat_found` is valid ‚Ä?fabricating a generic threat is forbidden. Side output `parametric_family_concern`: a named un-retrieved mechanism family from parametric knowledge (family name + query vocabulary, never specific paper cites) ‚Ä?soft signal only, flows to Phase 4 reviewer_concerns as a "scoop-check X first" flag |
| falsification_structure_check | does `falsification_prediction` name the minimal experiment, the outcome metric + direction, ONE load-bearing variable, and a NON-tautological negative control targeting the downstream metric? |

Verdict is two-layer. **Hard floor** (LLM cannot override) ‚Ü?`abandon`: triggered Reject lesson / unmitigatable anti-pattern / exact-mechanism collision. **Soft judgment** otherwise ‚Ü?`advance` (only trivial borderlines; concerns surface in Phase 4's reviewer_concerns) or `revise` with concrete `revision_targets[]` (scopes: `tactical` / `sub_pattern` / `falsification`). `verdict_rationale` must cite specific check findings. The audit judges only ‚Ä?it never modifies the candidate.

**Routing on verdict:**

- **advance** ‚Ü?Phase 4 reads the 2.2 candidate directly.
- **revise** ‚Ü?**3.3** (one isolated LLM call, prompt [references/system-prompts/revise.txt](references/system-prompts/revise.txt)): reads candidate + 2.1 spec + the revision brief (`phase3_revise_brief` ‚Ä?`next` materializes `revise_brief.json`, the audit minus the bulky reject-lesson quotations; full report stays on disk for lesson-specific lookups); emits patch-only `applied_revisions[]` ‚Ä?one entry per revision_target, ops `replace` / `append_sentence` / `append_items` / `swap_sub_pattern` / `rewrite_falsification`, never echoes the candidate, never re-judges the verdict. Then run the **merger** (entry-point table, WITH `--critique`) ‚Ü?writes `phase3_revise/final_candidate.json` + back-injects it into the patch file. Kill-switch fields are merger-refused with ONE audited exception: a `scope=falsification` target from `falsification_structure_check` is applied via the dedicated `rewrite_falsification` op (authorization verified against the audit report via `--critique`; same experiment/metric/claim, structure repaired; max one per run). When the merger prints `falsification_rewritten`, run the **falsification re-audit** (self-contained prompt [references/system-prompts/falsification_reaudit.txt](references/system-prompts/falsification_reaudit.txt), reading the `phase3_falsification_view` slice of `final_candidate.json` ‚Ü?`phase3_critique/falsification_reaudit.json`): `advance` ‚Ü?Phase 4; `abandon` ‚Ü?`phase_3_failed.md`. `compute_budget` has no revision route under any scope. No `composition` scope ‚Ä?gap-level changes route through the abandon-retry below, never through patches.
- **abandon** ‚Ü?**one internal retry** (the one-shot guarantee bars asking the user, not internal regeneration): if `$RUN_DIR/.retry_used` is absent, archive the attempt and regenerate ‚Ä?

  ```bash
  mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/attempt_1" && \
  mv "$RUN_DIR/phase2_select" "$RUN_DIR/phase2_generate" "$RUN_DIR/phase2_coherence" "$RUN_DIR/phase3_collision" \
     "$RUN_DIR/phase3_critique" "$RUN_DIR/phase3_revise" "$RUN_DIR/attempt_1/" 2>/dev/null; \
  touch "$RUN_DIR/.retry_used"
  ```

  then re-run Phase 2 in retry mode (archived audit + selection = negative constraints; blocking obstacle findings = POSITIVE directives the new mechanism must confront), citation gate, 3.1, 3.2. Phase 0/1 artifacts are reused as-is.

  **Second `abandon` ‚Ü?failure attribution decides** (deterministic, `next` encodes it): when BOTH attempts died by exact-mechanism subsumption (`paper_pointed_threat.addressable_via = "unaddressable"` in both critique reports) and `.bottleneck_retry_used` is absent, the occupied space indicts the BOTTLENECK FRAMING, not generation ‚Ü?**one bottleneck-level retry**: archive everything incl. `phase1/` to `attempt_2/`, re-run Phase 1 in BOTTLENECK-RETRY MODE (retired bottleneck_statement + both attempts' threat papers = negative anchors; `do_not_generate` remains a legitimate, preferred exit over a blander re-framing), then ONE candidate attempt on the new bottleneck (`.retry_used` stays set) ‚Ä?whole-run worst case 3 gauntlet cycles. Any other second `abandon` (mechanism-level deaths ‚Ä?those indict generation, and a third roll has diminishing returns), or any abandon after the bottleneck retry ‚Ü?write `phase_3_failed.md` citing EVERY attempt's verdict_rationale + triggering checks + user-side options ‚Ä?terminal.

### Phase 4 ‚Ä?Expansion + packaging

Six steps in order (`next` emits each with the correct flags for the advance vs revise path ‚Ä?on the revise path `--candidate` is `final_candidate.json` and `--phase3-revise` is passed; on advance it's the CANONICAL candidate (refined_candidate.json when 2.3 patched, else the 2.2 output) and the flag is omitted):

1. **skeleton** (orchestrator): populates every mechanical field ‚Ä?kill-switch echoes (byte-identical from the candidate), `differentiation_from_lit` venue_years, `almost_prior_venue_year`, `why_prior_stopped[].paper_id/venue_year`, `domain_landscape` (pattern_distribution + candidate_uses), `literature_breakdown`, `reviewer_concerns_and_responses[].attack/severity/fields_changed_to_address` (lifted from audit + patch), `feasibility_validation.compute` (bucketed against `intake.compute`) ‚Ä?and marks every prose field `<TODO[path]: hint>`.
2. **fill** (one isolated LLM call, prompt [references/system-prompts/expand.txt](references/system-prompts/expand.txt)): author the TECHNICAL TODO paths as one flat `{path: value}` map ‚Ü?`phase4/fill_map.json`. The derive-owned paths (`title_zh` + all `plain_*`) are explicitly EXCLUDED ‚Ä?the derive step owns them. No calendar projections; no experiment matrix / ablation plan / baseline table ‚Ä?the skill produces IDEA + falsifiability + feasibility judgment, not experimental engineering.
3. **assemble (partial) ‚Ü?derive ‚Ü?assemble (final)**: the orchestrator assembles the technical map first (`phase4_expansion.json`, derive-owned placeholders remain ‚Ä?the WARN is expected); then **derive** (one isolated LLM call, prompt [references/system-prompts/derive_plain.txt](references/system-prompts/derive_plain.txt)) mechanically rewrites the finished technical fields into the plain register (`title_zh` + `plain_*` ‚Ü?`phase4/derive_map.json`) ‚Ä?register transformation + translation with NO new facts, so it runs on the CLASSIFY_FAST tier by default (fallback ladder: `NOVELTY_LLM_CLASSIFY_FAST_CMD` ‚Ü?host cheap model ‚Ü?host model isolated; even the last rung keeps it cheap since the input is only the finished prose); then the final assemble merges both maps (`phase4_assemble --fill-map <tech> --fill-map <derive>` ‚Ä?overlapping paths are a hard error) and extracts `phase4/method_view.json` (`phase4_method_view` ‚Ä?the method-only slice the 4.1.5 audit reads: method_flow + plain steps + key_equations + claims). The assembler validates every path resolves to a real TODO and refuses kill-switch roots per map.
4. **implementability audit (4.1.5, one isolated LLM call, default on):** prompt [references/system-prompts/implementability_audit.txt](references/system-prompts/implementability_audit.txt) ‚Ä?fresh skeptical-engineer persona (separate from the 4.fill author) reads `method_view.json` (fallback: the full expansion) and rewrites each method step into a buildable spec: `enriched_steps[]` (one per step, same ids/order, `what_changes` + `what_to_do_en` + `what_to_do_zh`) + `underspecified_points[]` (`{step_id, hole, fill, severity: filled|open}` ‚Ä?unfillable holes stay honest as `open`). Compute-agnostic by design (resource feasibility is 4.1's job); never adds/removes/renames steps; never carries kill-switch fields. Output `phase4/phase4_implementability.json`.
5. **validate + render:** run the validators (below), then `phase4_render` ‚Ä?templating only, no model call; auto-detects the sibling implementability file and merges `enriched_steps` by step_id into the rendered Method (deterministic; no-op when absent). Writes `idea.std.zh.md` (plain Chinese, domain-newcomer register) + `idea.std.en.md` (plain English) + `idea.detail.en.md` (rigorous English ‚Ä?the novelty + validity defense) + `idea.std.{en,zh}.tex` (auto-compiled to PDF when xelatex/tectonic is on PATH; skipped with a hint otherwise).

**Final response:** read all three markdown cards and return them inline under headings ‰∏≠ÊñáÁâ?/ English / Reviewer version. Other phase outputs stay on disk for inspection, not echoed.

## Validators

```bash
# advance path: --phase3 = phase3_critique_output.json; revise path: --phase3 = phase3_revise_output.json
# --phase2 = the CANONICAL candidate (refined_candidate.json when 2.3 patched, else the 2.2 output)
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/run.py" validate \
  --phase2 <canonical candidate file> \
  --phase3 <see comment> \
  --phase4 $RUN_DIR/phase4/phase4_expansion.json \
  --phase4-impl $RUN_DIR/phase4/phase4_implementability.json   # optional; enables implementability checks
```

| Validator | Check | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| **subpattern_citation_consistency** | each `gap_closure[].sub_pattern` resolves to a real C## cluster in overview.md whose true parent == the cited `main_pattern` and whose parenthetical == that cluster's parent display name. Primary use: the Phase 2.2 citation gate; re-runs harmlessly here. | fail (hard) |
| **kill_switch_integrity** | `falsification_prediction` + `compute_budget` byte-identical along Phase 2.2 ‚Ü?[3.3 final_candidate ‚Üí] 4. After an audited falsification rewrite (`falsification_rewritten` marker + matching applied `rewrite_falsification` entry ‚Ä?disagreement fails), the anchor for `falsification_prediction` re-bases at the 3.3 final_candidate (3.3 ‚Ü?4 must match); `compute_budget` stays full-chain always. | fail (hard) |
| **expansion_completeness** | motivation (‚â? `why_prior_stopped`), `method_flow.steps[]` (each with `linked_component` + `linked_falsification`), `feasibility_validation` (5 sub-verdicts + `overall`), non-empty `abstract_draft` + `core_claim` + `sub_claims[]` ‚Ä?missing sections would render as silent blanks. | fail (hard) |
| **implementability_completeness** | `enriched_steps[]` one-per-step (same ids/order, EN+ZH), `underspecified_points[]` present (`[]` allowed), NO kill-switch field in the file. | fail (hard) |
| **implementability_readability** | std-register fields: no `Âç†‰Ωç`/`placeholder` leak, no bare English jargon dropped into Chinese prose. | warn |

**Retry budget on `fail` (cap = 2).** Fix only the named contract, re-validate; still failing after the 2nd retry ‚Ü?stop revising, render as-is, and append a short note listing the failing validators (a flagged-imperfect card beats a watchdog-killed run with zero output). Never "fix" `kill_switch_integrity` or `subpattern_citation_consistency` by editing a guarded field ‚Ä?surface them as the headline caveat instead.

## Configuration

By default every model-driven phase runs on the host LLM. To route phases to a different backend (Gemini, open-weights, custom):

- `NOVELTY_LLM_REASONING_LARGE_CMD` ‚Ä?Phase 1 / 2.1 / 2.2 / 3.2 / 3.3 / 4.fill (needs ‚â?200k context, JSON output)
- `NOVELTY_LLM_CLASSIFY_FAST_CMD` ‚Ä?Phase 0 intent extraction + per-paper pattern tagging (smaller context, JSON output)

Each is a CLI taking a stdin prompt (`<<SYSTEM>>...<<USER>>...`) and emitting JSON on stdout. When unset (the default when running inside any host LLM), the orchestrator emits sentinel files and the host LLM handles those steps natively.

- `IDEASPARK_CROSS_RUN_DEDUP` ‚Ä?set to `off` to disable the sibling-run soft-negative-anchor scan in the Phase 2 emit (default: on).
- `IDEASPARK_DEFAULT_COMPUTE` ‚Ä?optional standing compute profile for the user (free text, e.g. `"8√óH100 node, ~300 GPU-days, $50k API budget"`). Put it in `.env` (auto-loaded); `next` surfaces it to Phase 1 as intake context. Precedence: compute stated in the user's query > this value > the factory default (80GB-class GPUs, ‚â? concurrent, ‚â?50 GPU-days / 5 months, ~$10k API campaign). Use this instead of editing the factory default ‚Ä?the default is the feasibility yardstick for users who state nothing.
