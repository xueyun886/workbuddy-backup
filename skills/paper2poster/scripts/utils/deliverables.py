"""Final deliverables-presence gate — the *forcing function* that prevents
"fill loop done = task done" rationalization.

The 12-step paper2poster workflow ends with four required artifacts in the
output directory:

  - ``assets/meta/paper_spec.md`` (Step 4)
  - ``poster.html``    (Steps 6-9, fill loop)
  - ``poster.pdf``     (Step 10, render_poster.py)
  - ``poster.png``     (Step 10, render_poster.py)

In practice, models running the skill **probabilistically skip Step 10** —
they finish the fill loop (which itself has slack/polish hard gates), see
``poster.html`` in place, and rationalize "all hard gates passed, task done"
without ever invoking ``render_poster.py``. Observed N=2/3 skip rate on the
same paper across two sessions; not deterministic, can't be fixed by
adding more prose to SKILL.md.

This command is the deterministic check the model is required to run before
declaring done. It exits 1 with an explicit "missing X, run Y" message so the
failure forces the correct corrective action — no editorial judgment, no
self-evaluation.

Usage:
  check_poster.py deliverables <outdir>

Exit codes:
  0  all four files exist and meet minimum size thresholds
  1  one or more missing or suspiciously small (with remediation guidance)
  2  invalid argument (outdir doesn't exist or isn't a directory)
