"""Extract text, figures, AND figure captions from a research paper PDF.

Usage: extract.py <pdf> --outdir <dir>

Produces (under the canonical assets/ bundle layout — see utils/layout.py):
  <outdir>/assets/figures/      — PNG images extracted from the PDF
  <outdir>/assets/meta/text.txt — full text via pdftotext (layout-preserving)
  <outdir>/assets/meta/figures.json   — manifest [{file, page, width, height, caption, caption_label}, ...]
                            where `file` is the root-relative `assets/figures/<name>.png`.
  <outdir>/assets/meta/captions.json  — all "Figure N: ..." / "Table N: ..." captions parsed from text
                            keyed by label ("Figure 1", "Table 2", ...)
  <outdir>/assets/meta/metadata.json  — first-page metadata: {venue, year, emails, code_url,
                            project_url, paper_url, arxiv_id, doi}
                            Every field is best-effort; unparseable fields are empty
                            strings (or empty lists for `emails`). Never fabricated.

Why captions matter: a poster lives or dies on picking the right figure (architecture
diagram, headline results plot) and skipping decorative or equation-as-image junk.
Captions are the cheapest, most reliable signal of what a figure actually shows, so
we extract them alongside the images and let the model match figures to captions.
