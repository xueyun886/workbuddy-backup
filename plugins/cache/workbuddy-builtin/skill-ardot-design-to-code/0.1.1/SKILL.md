# Ardot Design-to-Code & Style Extraction

Domain workflows for **design → frontend code** conversion and **website → style-guide** extraction on the Ardot canvas.

> **The general workflow and hard rules live in `ardot-design-core`**, which is injected alongside this skill. Follow `ardot-design-core` for the step sequence, schema, editing rules, effects, and screenshot verification. This skill carries the **specialized conversion/extraction workflows and implementation guidelines**.

## Specialized Workflows (follow strictly — do NOT improvise the procedure)

- **Design → frontend code** → `{SKILL_ROOT}/workflows/design-to-code-workflow.md` — design → HTML/CSS/JS, generate Application, to code, slide transitions, responsive scaling.
- **Website → style guide extraction** → `{SKILL_ROOT}/workflows/extract-style-guide-from-web.md` — pull a design guide / tokens from an existing website.

## Implementation Guidelines (load alongside a design-type guideline when generating code)

- `{SKILL_ROOT}/references/guidelines-code.md` — design-to-code implementation rules.
- `{SKILL_ROOT}/references/guidelines-tailwind.md` — Tailwind v4 implementation (load alongside `guidelines-code.md`).

> Files referenced by these workflows that live in the core skill are read from the **ardot-design-core** skill root — its absolute path is provided in the same prompt that injected this skill. This includes `design-rules.md` etc. and the shared **tool-usage guides** (`tool-usage/batch-edit.md`, `tool-usage/apply-variables.md`), which now live in `ardot-design-core` because `batch_edit` / `apply_variables` are used by every Ardot task.
